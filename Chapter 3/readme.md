* Abstraction is 1 of 4 fundamental object-orrientes concepts

* use Functions, functions acts like methods
    * all people need to know is the parameters required
    * what is the return value

* Parameterization is how an argument is used inside the argument of a function
    * call by value passes value is copied, acts like immutable objects
    * call by reference refers to the same value as passed, acts like mutable objects
