# Chapter 2 - Variables, Types, Values, Operations, Models, & Garbage

## Varables, Types, Values

* Variables a name that refes to a value
* Variable are mutable or immutable depening on type
* Variables have scope
    * There are 2 types of Scopes
        * 1 - Global
        * 2 - Local
        * use the dir() function to find the list of objects that are in the scope
* Lifetime is the length of time an obect exist
* Variable Names
    * choose variable name that have meaning and corresponds with what they are programming
    * document all your variables
    * Rules for Variables
        * can contain both letters and numbers
        * cannot begin with a number
        * use camel back notation
        * use the underscore charater to have multiple words in a variable name

* Python Keywords are keywords that cannot be used as variables
* Expression is a combination of values, variable, and operators
* Statement is a unit of code tht does someting

* Python has a interactive mode and script mode
    * Interactive mode you enter lines of codes one by one
    * Script mode is when you save a file of code and then run it later

* when computing math with code, code still follows the order of operations
    * PEMDAS
    * Strings have there own operations
        * For Example when trying to concatenate a sting you cannot concatenate a string and an int
* When writing code it should be come a good habit to leave notes where needed
    * note in programming are reffered to as comments

## Garbage

* Errors ocurr and in programming we call them bugs, when fixing these errors it is called debugging

* when the errors arise some of the most common being
    * Syntax Error - refers to your structure
    * Runtime Error - error does not appear untill after the program has ran
    * Semantic Error - runs but does not do what was written
